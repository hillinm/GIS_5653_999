The Excel table lists all species included in the analyses, their IUCN Red List status at the time of the analyses, the amount of their range overlapping with various IUCN categories of protected areas (category 7 indicates no IUCN category assigned), and the value of the priority index for the species.  PA overlap area is in meters square.

Raster files are in TIFF format, LZW compressed, and georeferenced (datum WGS84). Rasters of biodiversity and priorities are in the World Eckert IV projection, which is equal area. 

Files should be compatible with any standard GIS software.
